# Node.js Architecture Summary

## 1. Introduction to Node.js Architecture
- Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to build scalable network applications.
- It differs from traditional server-side languages like PHP or Java by enabling asynchronous, event-driven programming.

## 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- Node.js uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
- The event loop is at the core, allowing Node.js to handle multiple requests concurrently without waiting for each to finish.

## 3. Single-Threaded Model
- Node.js operates on a single thread, handling multiple requests through the event loop and callbacks.
- Despite being single-threaded, it can handle concurrency efficiently using asynchronous behavior.

## 4. Event Loop
- The event loop is responsible for checking events and executing corresponding callbacks.
- It enables Node.js to perform non-blocking operations like file I/O or database queries.

## 5. Non-Blocking I/O
- Node.js performs I/O operations (e.g., file reading, database queries) in a non-blocking manner, meaning other tasks can continue executing without waiting for I/O operations to complete.

## 6. Worker Pool
- For certain tasks (like file operations), Node.js offloads them to the worker pool, allowing for concurrent processing of I/O tasks.

## 7. Node.js Process Model
- Node.js runs with a single event loop thread but can handle multiple worker threads for specific tasks like file system operations.

## 8. Modules and Event Emitter
- Node.js uses modules to handle specific functionalities.
- The EventEmitter class helps handle events and triggers callbacks for specific actions.

## 9. Understanding Callbacks
- Callbacks are critical in Node.js to enable asynchronous operations, ensuring that other code can execute without being blocked while waiting for I/O operations.

## 10. Real-World Example (Optional)
- Node.jsâ€™s event-driven architecture is ideal for building applications like web servers, APIs, or real-time chat applications, where multiple users need to interact with the system concurrently.
